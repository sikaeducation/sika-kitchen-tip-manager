## Sika Kitchen: Tip Manager

You are being tasked with building a tip management tool for the Sika Kitchen restaurant. Watch [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnFATIW27Mw) with the manager of the restaurant, and decide:

* What features you need to build
* How those translate to user stories
* What the acceptance criteria for those stories should be
* How those user stories should be prioritized

User stories should be in the `user` / `need` / `reason` format. Acceptance criteria should be listed below, and should be black & white- they are either done or not. For example:

```
1. As a race car driver, I need to accelerate the car so I can win races.

* The car doesn't accelerate when the gas pedal isn't pressed
* When gas pedal is depressed, the car goes faster
* Holding the gas pedal down accelerates the car from 0 MPH to 60 MPH or more in under 5 seconds
```

You are going to have the opportunity to ask the manager questions, but you need to put together something to start the conversation. Update the `user_stories.md` document with your prioritized user stories, and write a brief justification for your prioritization when you're done.
