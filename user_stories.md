1. As a server, I need to see my tips so I can keep track of how much I've made

* A user can see a list of all received tips
* Tips are in descending chronological order
* Each tip is displayed alongside the bill amount
* Each tip is displayed alongside the percentage amount of the bill it represents

2. As a server, I need to see an analysis of my tips so I can make decisions about what shifts to request

* All tip amounts for the last month are graphed with a line graph, label on the 
* All tip percentages for the last month are graphed on the same graph on a secondary axis
* Periods of time 1 standard deviation or more above the median are highlighted

3. As a customer, I need to tip my server electronically so my tipping interactions are faster

* A user can enter a tip between $1 and $1000
* A user can enter a 20% tip in under 5 seconds

4. As a server, I need to split tips with other employees so I can reward them for helping me

* A user can choose an amount of their tips to split
* A user can choose a percentage of their tips to split
* A user can allocate a split to another user of the system
* A user can allocate a split to the kitchen, which will be evenly divided between active kitchen workers
* A user can allocate a split to the hosts, which will be evenly split between hosts working during the current shift

The customer said that things that involve the server understanding their tips were more important than the others, and seeing tips happens along the way to analyzing them. Similarly, splitting tips is dependent on processing them in the first place.
